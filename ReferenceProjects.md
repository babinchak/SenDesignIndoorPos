2cm indoor precision
uses ultrasonic beacons in 915/868 MHz or 433MHz band
  less expensive than ultrawideband(UWB)
uses time-of-flight(ToF) to calculate distance
3 beacons using triangulization to get position
Article says bluetooth-low-energy(BLE) systems using signal strength only yield 3-10m accuracy.
